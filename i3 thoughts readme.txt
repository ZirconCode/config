# i3 improvements

# no desktop window when starting nautilus
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false

# clipboard emptied when container closed??

# hotkeys
# shift alt c to close, alt p to dmenu
# function keys

# 'xmobar' no it's i3bar now? hmm.

# 'do it by mouse' <- ahhh, bindsym $mod+Left focus left
# the jkl; mapping is horrible
# AHHHHhhhHHHHHH

# disable mouspad key

# verdict, i3 much worse than xmonad so far

# second verdict, ok
# I dislike the tree structure, it takes too many extra key pressed, automatic layoud and only one container?

# resisizing windows requires a mode... extra key presses
# nagbar..?
# there is no border to show activeness of gedit window??


# screenshot
# wifi?

## why gedit still has no border?

# useful:
xrandr
arandr
xev

#lock on close? 

# something is very off about the borders...

# todo

# bind arandr
# bind toggle mouse

# dock i3bar at top, also display title of window inside the bar, ok good now? depends on mode

# third verdict, still ugly but I can live with this. not convinced of how I need to tell it to split

# requires: xss-lock, some other stuff to be installed for hotkeys to actually run
# meh can't get lock on close to work


#TODO: configure i3status
https://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html

# 


# use tridactyl addon firefox, mpsyt for music temporary

# pipe dmenu order into most used

# background/lockscreen image? mm..
